## Introduction

The **3D Frame Solver** is designed to:
- Assemble the global stiffness matrix for the structure.
- Apply the boundary conditions.
- Solve the reduced system for nodal displacements and rotations.
- Compute the support reactions.

This solver is particularly useful for engineers, researchers, and students involved in structural analysis of frames in civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering domains.

## Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Local Elastic Stiffness Matrix
The local elastic stiffness matrix for a 3D beam element is computed using:

$$
k_e = 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11} & k_{12} \\
k_{21} & k_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where:
- $k_{11}, k_{12}, k_{21}, k_{22}$ are sub-matrices representing axial, torsional, and bending stiffness contributions.

### 2. Global Stiffness Matrix
The global stiffness matrix is assembled by transforming the local stiffness matrix into the global coordinate system using:

$$
K_{global} = \Gamma^T k_{local} \Gamma
$$

Where:
- $\Gamma$ is the 12x12 transformation matrix calculated using the rotation matrix for the element.

### 3. Displacement and Reaction Calculation
The system of equations is solved using:

$$
K_{reduced} d_{free} = F_{reduced}
$$

Reactions at the supports are calculated as:

$$
R = K d - F
$$

Where:
- $d$ is the vector of nodal displacements and rotations.
- $F$ is the global load vector.
- $R$ is the reaction vector at constrained degrees of freedom.

## Installation

To use the 3D Frame Solver, you need to have **Python** and **NumPy** installed on your system.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- NumPy

### Installation

**Please ensure that you run the following commands in the terminal after downloading the repository (Please ensure that repository is not in the downloads folder and their relative locations are not changed.)**\
To install the package, first create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create --name direct-stiffness-env python=3.12
```
Once the environment has been created, activate it:
```bash
conda activate direct-stiffness-env
```
Double check that python is version 3.12 in the environment:
```bash
python --version
```
Please ensure that pip is using the most up to date version of setuptools:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
Create the editable install of the Direct Stiffness Method code (note: you must be in the correct directory, i.e. where all of the files of the repository are.)
```bash
pip install -e .
```
Test the code is working with pytest
```bash
pytest -v --cov=directstiffnessmethod --cov-report term-missing
```
