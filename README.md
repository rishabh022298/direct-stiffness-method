## Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Local Elastic Stiffness Matrix
The local elastic stiffness matrix for a 3D beam element is computed using:

$$
k_e = 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11} & k_{12} \\
k_{21} & k_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where:
- $k_{11}, k_{12}, k_{21}, k_{22}$ are sub-matrices representing axial, torsional, and bending stiffness contributions.

### 2. Global Stiffness Matrix
The global stiffness matrix is assembled by transforming the local stiffness matrix into the global coordinate system using:

$$
K_{global} = \Gamma^T k_{local} \Gamma
$$

Where:
- $\Gamma$ is the 12x12 transformation matrix calculated using the rotation matrix for the element.

### 3. Displacement and Reaction Calculation
The system of equations is solved using:

$$
K_{reduced} d_{free} = F_{reduced}
$$

Reactions at the supports are calculated as:

$$
R = K d - F
$$

Where:
- $d$ is the vector of nodal displacements and rotations.
- $F$ is the global load vector.
- $R$ is the reaction vector at constrained degrees of freedom.

### 4. Nonlinear Elastic Stiffness
The core equation for nonlinear elastic stiffness problem is:


$$
[K_e + \lambda K_g]\Delta = 0
$$

Where:
- $K_e$ is the elastic stiffness matrix.
- $K_g$ is the geometric stiffness matrix.
- $\lambda$ are the eigenvalues (load factor).
- $\Delta$ are the eigenvectors (buckling modes).

## Input Format
### Importing Required Libraries
```python
from directstiffnessmethod import direct_stiffness_method as dsm
from directstiffnessmethod import elastic_critical_load_solver as ecls
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Set matplotlib display settings
%matplotlib inline
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (10, 10)
```
### Direct Stiffness Method
Script can be used for evaluation as follows:
Once the required libraries have been imported, then user needs to define the nodes and their locations (let's say there are three nodes):
```python
# Define node coordinates (node ID: [x, y, z])
nodes = {
  0: np.array([0.0, 5.0, 0.0]),
  1: np.array([5.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
  2: np.array([5.0, 5.0, 0.0])
}
```
Next, user needs to define material and geometrical properties of various elements. This can be done in the following way (let's say for a 2 element structure):
```python
# Each element is defined as: (node1, node2, section_properties)
section_props_element_1 = {
  "E": 210e9,           # Young's modulus
  "nu": 0.3,            # Poisson's ratio
  "A": 0.01,            # Cross-sectional area
  "Iz": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local z axis
  "Iy": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local y axis
  "J": 1.67e-5,         # Torsional constant
  "local_z": np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])  # Reference vector for orientation
 # Please ensure that local_z is not parallel to the element itself otherwise the user will get a ValueError
}

section_props_element_2 = {
  "E": 210e9,           # Young's modulus in Pascals
  "nu": 0.3,            # Poisson's ratio
  "A": 0.01,            # Cross-sectional area
  "Iz": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local z axis
  "Iy": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local y axis
  "J": 1.67e-5,         # Torsional constant
  "local_z": np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])  # Reference vector for orientation
# Please ensure that local_z is not parallel to the element itself otherwise the user will get a ValueError
}
```
Once the properties haves been defined, then user can move on to finalising the geometry by defining which nodes are connected and what are the properties of those elements.
```python
elements = [
  (0, 2, section_props_element_1),
  (1, 2, section_props_element_2)
]
```
After defining the elements, nodal forces and boundary conditions can be defined in any order.
```python
# For each node, a load vector [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz] is applied.
loads = {
  2: np.array([0.0, -10000.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])  # Applied at node 2 (e.g., vertical load)
}
```
```python
# For each node, provide a list of 6 (u_x, u_y, u_z, rot_x, rot_y, rot_z) booleans (True = DOF is fixed).
supports = {
  0: [False, True, True, False, False, True],  # Displacement in x and rotation along x and y are allowed at node 0
  1: [True, True, True, True, True, True]      # Node 1 is fully fixed
}
```
Once the user is satisfied with the geometry and the applied nodal loads and boundary conditions, then the solver can be initiated:
```python
solver = dsm.Frame3DSolver(nodes, elements, loads, supports)
displacements, reactions = solver.solve()
```
Reshaping and printing the results:
```python
disp_matrix = displacements.reshape((-1, 6))
reac_matrix = reactions.reshape((-1, 6))
# Create a dictionary for displacements and reactions
disp_dict = {node: disp_matrix[i] for i, node in enumerate(nodes)}
react_dict = {node: reac_matrix[i] for i, node in enumerate(nodes)}
    
# Output the results
print("Nodal Displacements and Rotations:")
for node, disp in disp_dict.items():
  print(f"Node {node}: [u: {disp[0]:.6f}, v: {disp[1]:.6f}, w: {disp[2]:.6f}, "
        f"rot_x: {disp[3]:.6f}, rot_y: {disp[4]:.6f}, rot_z: {disp[5]:.6f}]")
    
print("\nReaction Forces and Moments at Supports:")
for node, react in react_dict.items():
  # Only display reactions for nodes with boundary conditions
  if node in supports:
    print(f"Node {node}: [Fx: {react[0]:.2f}, Fy: {react[1]:.2f}, Fz: {react[2]:.2f}, "
          f"Mx: {react[3]:.2f}, My: {react[4]:.2f}, Mz: {react[5]:.2f}]")
```
Computing internal forces and moments and plotting them for each element:
```python
internal_forces = solver.compute_internal_forces_and_moments(displacements)
solver.plot_internal_forces_and_moments(internal_forces)
```
Plotting deformed shape:
```python
solver.plot_deformed_shape(displacements, scale=25)  # Adjust scale as per your requirement
```
### Elastic Critical Load Analysis
Nodes, elements, loads and boundary conditions can be used from direct stiffness method, or they can be defined again in a similar manner:
```python
nodes_ecls = {
    0: np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
    1: np.array([5.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
    2: np.array([5.0, 5.0, 0.0]),
    3: np.array([0.0, 5.0, 0.0])
}
"""
User can input element properties as demonstrated below. If I_rho is not provided then function will take I_rho = J as default.
"""
elements_ecls = [
    (0, 1, {"E": 210e9, "nu": 0.3, "A": 0.01, "Iz": 1.0e-6, "Iy": 1.0e-6, "J": 1.0e-6}),
    (1, 2, {"E": 210e9, "nu": 0.3, "A": 0.01, "Iz": 1.0e-6, "Iy": 1.0e-6, "J": 1.0e-6, "I_rho": 2.0e-6})
]

loads_ecls = {
    1: np.array([0.1, -0.05, -0.075, 0, 0, 0]),
    2: np.array([0, 0, 0, 0.5, -0.1, 0.3])
}

supports_ecls = {
    0: [True, True, True, True, True, True],
    3: [True, True, True, True, True, True]
}
```
Then the solver can be initiated:
```python
frame_solver_ecla = dsm.Frame3DSolver(nodes_ecls, elements_ecls, loads_ecls, supports_ecls)
```
Then solver can be used for both with and without the interaction terms and the load factors can be printed as well as buckling modes can be plotted:
```python
# Solve for buckling modes with and without interaction terms
for use_interaction in [False, True]:
    solver_type = "Without Interaction Terms" if not use_interaction else "With Interaction Terms"
    print(f"Solving for {solver_type}")

    ecl_solver = ecls.ElasticCriticalLoadSolver(frame_solver_ecla, use_interaction_terms=use_interaction)
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = ecl_solver.solve_eigenvalue_problem()

    print("Critical Load Factors:", eigenvalues)
    print(f"Lowest Critical Load Factor: {np.min(eigenvalues)}")

    ecl_solver.plot_buckling_mode(eigenvectors[:, 0], scale=100)
```
**Note:** User is expected to take care of units while giving the inputs. Make sure they are consistent throughout.


## Error Handling

This 3D Frame Solver includes comprehensive error handling to ensure robust and reliable computations. The error handling is categorized into the following areas:

---

### 1. Input Validation

- **Data Type Checks**: Ensures all inputs are of the correct data type.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not isinstance(nodes, dict):
        raise TypeError("nodes must be a dictionary.")
    ```
- **Shape and Length Checks**: Verifies the dimensions of arrays and lists.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if vec.shape != (3,):
        raise ValueError("vec must be a 3-element vector.")
    ```
- **Value Checks**: Confirms that input values are within expected ranges.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not (0 <= nu < 0.5):
        raise ValueError("Poisson's ratio (nu) must be between 0 and 0.5.")
    ```

---

### 2. Numerical Stability

- **Condition Number Check**: Checks for numerical singularity in the global stiffness matrix.
  - Example:
    ```python
    cond_number = np.linalg.cond(K_reduced)
    if cond_number > 1e12:
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError("Global stiffness matrix is nearly singular.")
    ```
- **NaN and Inf Checks**: Ensures no NaN or Inf values appear in the solution.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.any(np.isnan(d_free)) or np.any(np.isinf(d_free)):
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError("Solution contains NaN or Inf.")
    ```

---

### 3. Physical Validity Checks

- **Unreasonable Displacement Magnitudes**: Identifies unrealistic displacements due to numerical instability.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.any(np.abs(d_free) > 1e6):
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError("Unreasonably large displacements detected.")
    ```
- **Element Length Check**: Ensures that elements have positive nonzero lengths.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.isclose(L, 0.0):
        raise ValueError("Element length cannot be zero.")
    ```

---

### 4. Structural Integrity Checks

- **Unit Vector Verification**: Checks that the reference vector is a unit vector.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not np.isclose(np.linalg.norm(vec), 1.0):
        raise ValueError("Expected a unit vector for reference vector.")
    ```
- **Parallel Vector Check**: Ensures that reference vectors are not parallel to the beam axis.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.isclose(np.linalg.norm(np.cross(vec_1, vec_2)), 0.0):
        raise ValueError("Reference vector is parallel to beam axis.")
    ```

---

### 5. Consistency Checks

- **Element Definition Check**: Ensures each element is defined with two nodes and section properties.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if len(elem) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Each element must be a tuple of (node1, node2, properties).")
    ```
- **Boundary Condition Checks**: Verifies that boundary conditions are specified as lists of booleans.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not all(isinstance(x, bool) for x in bc):
        raise TypeError("Boundary conditions must be booleans.")
    ```

---

### 6. Result Validation

- **Shape Checks for Results**: Ensures that the shape of the reactions vector is consistent with the degrees of freedom.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if reactions.shape != (self.ndof,):
        raise ValueError("Reactions vector must be of length ndof.")
    ```

---

### 7. Exception Handling

- **Numerical Errors**: Catches and raises informative errors for numerical issues during system solving.
  - Example:
    ```python
    try:
        d_free = np.linalg.solve(K_reduced, F_reduced)
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError as e:
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError(f"Error solving system of equations: {e}")
    ```
This comprehensive approach to error handling ensures that the 3D Frame Solver is both robust and user-friendly, significantly reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and numerical instabilities.

## In Class Exercise
A notebook ***Direct_Stiffness_Method_and_Buckling_Analysis.ipynb*** is provided with the basic structure. User is expected to add nodes, elements, proerties, etc in the provided space by editing the notebook (preferably in VSCode) to analyse the frame given in the class during code review. Once the codeblocks has been finalised after adding the necessary details, user is required to execute each code block in an order as they appear.
