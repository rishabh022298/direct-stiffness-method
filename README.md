## Introduction

The **3D Frame Solver** is designed to:
- Assemble the global stiffness matrix for the structure.
- Apply the boundary conditions.
- Solve the reduced system for nodal displacements and rotations.
- Compute the support reactions.

This solver is particularly useful for engineers, researchers, and students involved in structural analysis of frames in civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering domains.

## Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Local Elastic Stiffness Matrix
The local elastic stiffness matrix for a 3D beam element is computed using:

$$
k_e = 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11} & k_{12} \\
k_{21} & k_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where:
- $$k_{11}, k_{12}, k_{21}, k_{22}$$ are sub-matrices representing axial, torsional, and bending stiffness contributions.

### 2. Global Stiffness Matrix
The global stiffness matrix is assembled by transforming the local stiffness matrix into the global coordinate system using:

$$
K_{global} = \Gamma^T k_{local} \Gamma
$$

Where:
- $ \Gamma $ is the 12x12 transformation matrix calculated using the rotation matrix for the element.

### 3. Displacement and Reaction Calculation
The system of equations is solved using:

$$
K_{reduced} d_{free} = F_{reduced}
$$

Reactions at the supports are calculated as:

$$
R = K d - F
$$

Where:
- $ d $ is the vector of nodal displacements and rotations.
- $ F $ is the global load vector.
- $ R $ is the reaction vector at constrained degrees of freedom.
