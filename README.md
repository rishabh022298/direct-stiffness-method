## Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Local Elastic Stiffness Matrix
The local elastic stiffness matrix for a 3D beam element is computed using:

$$
k_e = 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11} & k_{12} \\
k_{21} & k_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where:
- $k_{11}, k_{12}, k_{21}, k_{22}$ are sub-matrices representing axial, torsional, and bending stiffness contributions.

### 2. Global Stiffness Matrix
The global stiffness matrix is assembled by transforming the local stiffness matrix into the global coordinate system using:

$$
K_{global} = \Gamma^T k_{local} \Gamma
$$

Where:
- $\Gamma$ is the 12x12 transformation matrix calculated using the rotation matrix for the element.

### 3. Displacement and Reaction Calculation
The system of equations is solved using:

$$
K_{reduced} d_{free} = F_{reduced}
$$

Reactions at the supports are calculated as:

$$
R = K d - F
$$

Where:
- $d$ is the vector of nodal displacements and rotations.
- $F$ is the global load vector.
- $R$ is the reaction vector at constrained degrees of freedom.

To install the package, first create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create --name direct-stiffness-env python=3.12
```
Once the environment has been created, activate it:
```bash
conda activate direct-stiffness-env
```
Double check that python is version 3.12 in the environment:
```bash

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
Create the editable install of the Direct Stiffness Method code (note: you must be in the correct directory, i.e. where all of the files of the repository are.)
```bash
pip install -e .
```
Test the code is working with pytest
```bash
pytest -v --cov=directstiffnessmethod --cov-report term-missing
```
## Input Format
Script can be used for evaluation as follows:

```python
from directstiffnessmethod import direct_stiffness_method as dsm
import numpy as np
```
First user needs to define the nodes and their locations (let's say there are three nodes):
```python
# Define node coordinates (node ID: [x, y, z])
nodes = {
  0: np.array([0.0, 5.0, 0.0]),
  1: np.array([5.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
  2: np.array([5.0, 5.0, 0.0])
}
```
Next, user needs to define material and geometrical properties of various elements. This can be done in the following way (let's say for a 2 element structure):
```python
# Each element is defined as: (node1, node2, section_properties)
section_props_element_1 = {
  "E": 210e9,           # Young's modulus in Pascals
  "nu": 0.3,            # Poisson's ratio
  "A": 0.01,            # Cross-sectional area in m^2
  "Iz": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local z axis in m^4
  "Iy": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local y axis in m^4
  "J": 1.67e-5,         # Torsional constant in m^4
  "local_z": np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])  # Reference vector for orientation
}

section_props_element_2 = {
  "E": 210e9,           # Young's modulus in Pascals
  "nu": 0.3,            # Poisson's ratio
  "A": 0.01,            # Cross-sectional area in m^2
  "Iz": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local z axis in m^4
  "Iy": 8.33e-6,        # Moment of inertia about local y axis in m^4
  "J": 1.67e-5,         # Torsional constant in m^4
  "local_z": np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])  # Reference vector for orientation
}
```
Once the properties haves been defined, then user can move on to finalising the geometry by defining which nodes are connected and what are the properties of those elements.
```python
elements = [
  (0, 2, section_props_element_1),
  (1, 2, section_props_element_2)
]
```
After defining the elements, nodal forces and boundary conditions can be defined in any order.
```python
# For each node, a load vector [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz] is applied.
loads = {
  2: np.array([0.0, -10000.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])  # Applied at node 2 (e.g., vertical load)
}
```
```python
# For each node, provide a list of 6 booleans (True = DOF is fixed).
supports = {
  0: [False, True, True, False, False, True],  # Node 0 is partially fixed
  1: [True, True, True, True, True, True]      # Node 1 is fully fixed
}
```
Once the user is satisfied with the geometry and the applied nodal loads and boundary conditions, then the solver can be initiated:
```python
solver = dsm.Frame3DSolver(nodes, elements, loads, supports)
displacements, reactions = solver.solve()
```
Reshaping and printing the results:
```python
# Create a dictionary for displacements and reactions
disp_dict = {node: disp_matrix[i] for i, node in enumerate(nodes)}
react_dict = {node: reac_matrix[i] for i, node in enumerate(nodes)}
    
# Output the results
print("Nodal Displacements and Rotations:")
for node, disp in disp_dict.items():
  print(f"Node {node}: [u: {disp[0]:.6f}, v: {disp[1]:.6f}, w: {disp[2]:.6f}, "
        f"rot_x: {disp[3]:.6f}, rot_y: {disp[4]:.6f}, rot_z: {disp[5]:.6f}]")
    
print("\nReaction Forces and Moments at Supports:")
for node, react in react_dict.items():
  # Only display reactions for nodes with boundary conditions
  if node in supports:
    print(f"Node {node}: [Fx: {react[0]:.2f}, Fy: {react[1]:.2f}, Fz: {react[2]:.2f}, "
          f"Mx: {react[3]:.2f}, My: {react[4]:.2f}, Mz: {react[5]:.2f}]")
```
**Note:** User is expected to take care of units while giving the inputs. Make sure they are consistent throughout.

## Output
The above script when ran properly will give an output which looks something like this:
```bash
Nodal Displacements and Rotations:
Node 0: [u: 0.000014, v: 0.000000, w: 0.000000, rot_x: 0.000000, rot_y: 0.000000, rot_z: 0.000000]
Node 1: [u: 0.000000, v: 0.000000, w: 0.000000, rot_x: 0.000000, rot_y: 0.000000, rot_z: 0.000000]
Node 2: [u: 0.000014, v: -0.000024, w: -0.000000, rot_x: 0.000000, rot_y: -0.000000, rot_z: -0.000006]

Reaction Forces and Moments at Supports:
Node 0: [Fx: -0.00, Fy: 1.60, Fz: 0.00, Mx: 0.00, My: 0.00, Mz: 6.00]
Node 1: [Fx: 0.00, Fy: 9998.40, Fz: 0.00, Mx: 0.00, My: 0.00, Mz: 2.00]
```

## Error Handling

This 3D Frame Solver includes comprehensive error handling to ensure robust and reliable computations. The error handling is categorized into the following areas:

---

### 1. Input Validation

- **Data Type Checks**: Ensures all inputs are of the correct data type.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not isinstance(nodes, dict):
        raise TypeError("nodes must be a dictionary.")
    ```
- **Shape and Length Checks**: Verifies the dimensions of arrays and lists.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if vec.shape != (3,):
        raise ValueError("vec must be a 3-element vector.")
    ```
- **Value Checks**: Confirms that input values are within expected ranges.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not (0 <= nu < 0.5):
        raise ValueError("Poisson's ratio (nu) must be between 0 and 0.5.")
    ```

---

### 2. Numerical Stability

- **Condition Number Check**: Checks for numerical singularity in the global stiffness matrix.
  - Example:
    ```python
    cond_number = np.linalg.cond(K_reduced)
    if cond_number > 1e12:
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError("Global stiffness matrix is nearly singular.")
    ```
- **NaN and Inf Checks**: Ensures no NaN or Inf values appear in the solution.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.any(np.isnan(d_free)) or np.any(np.isinf(d_free)):
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError("Solution contains NaN or Inf.")
    ```

---

### 3. Physical Validity Checks

- **Unreasonable Displacement Magnitudes**: Identifies unrealistic displacements due to numerical instability.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.any(np.abs(d_free) > 1e6):
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError("Unreasonably large displacements detected.")
    ```
- **Element Length Check**: Ensures that elements have positive nonzero lengths.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.isclose(L, 0.0):
        raise ValueError("Element length cannot be zero.")
    ```

---

### 4. Structural Integrity Checks

- **Unit Vector Verification**: Checks that the reference vector is a unit vector.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not np.isclose(np.linalg.norm(vec), 1.0):
        raise ValueError("Expected a unit vector for reference vector.")
    ```
- **Parallel Vector Check**: Ensures that reference vectors are not parallel to the beam axis.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if np.isclose(np.linalg.norm(np.cross(vec_1, vec_2)), 0.0):
        raise ValueError("Reference vector is parallel to beam axis.")
    ```

---

### 5. Consistency Checks

- **Element Definition Check**: Ensures each element is defined with two nodes and section properties.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if len(elem) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Each element must be a tuple of (node1, node2, properties).")
    ```
- **Boundary Condition Checks**: Verifies that boundary conditions are specified as lists of booleans.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if not all(isinstance(x, bool) for x in bc):
        raise TypeError("Boundary conditions must be booleans.")
    ```

---

### 6. Result Validation

- **Shape Checks for Results**: Ensures that the shape of the reactions vector is consistent with the degrees of freedom.
  - Example:
    ```python
    if reactions.shape != (self.ndof,):
        raise ValueError("Reactions vector must be of length ndof.")
    ```

---

### 7. Exception Handling

- **Numerical Errors**: Catches and raises informative errors for numerical issues during system solving.
  - Example:
    ```python
    try:
        d_free = np.linalg.solve(K_reduced, F_reduced)
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError as e:
        raise np.linalg.LinAlgError(f"Error solving system of equations: {e}")
    ```
This comprehensive approach to error handling ensures that the 3D Frame Solver is both robust and user-friendly, significantly reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and numerical instabilities.
